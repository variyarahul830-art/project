Suspense  React component : 

    is used to show a loading UI while React is waiting for something needed to show the screen.
    Show loading until it is ready to render
    
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
    <HomeClient />
    </Suspense>        :  Show <Loading /> until <HomeClient /> is ready to be shown.”

    1️⃣ <HomeClient />

    This is the actual screen/content you want the user to see.

    But:

    it might fetch data

    it might load JS code

    it might do async work

    So React can’t show it immediately.
